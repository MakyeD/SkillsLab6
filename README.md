Skills Lab Week 6 with Emily Worster

Introduction
----------------------

Our program asks the user to input their name and with that name it gets formed into a string that relates directly to the name variable.
Then it asks the user to put in their age which gets formed into an integer under the variable age. Then the code prints out the name and age in a sentence.

Installation
----------------------

1. First you're going to want to download the code from Github by pressing the green "Code" button.
2. Pree "Download ZIP".
3. You will also need to download an Integreated Development Environment that runs python.
4. Once you have both of these, simply upload the zip file into the IDE and click on the "Week6-Input (1).ipynb" file.

Usage
----------------------

1. Start by runnning code in the IDE.
2. When the code asks for your name, input it and pess enter
3. When the code asks for your age, input that as well and press enter.
4. The code will output your name and age in a sentence.

How to contribute
---------------------
We'd love for you to help improve our code!

1. Once code is in whatever IDE you are using, feel free to edit, make changes, and debug.
2. You can submmit your code to the repository by creating a new file and uploading your edited code.
