Skills Lab Week 6 with Emily Worster

Our program asks the user to input their name and with that name it gets formed into a string that relates directly to the name variable.
Then it asks the user to put in their age which gets formed into an int under the variable age. Then the code prints out the name and age using string concatenation 
within the print line statement to form the sentence that is printed at the end.
